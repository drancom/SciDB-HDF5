SciDB-HDF5

Quick notes
-----------

Prerequisites:
A checkout of SciDB  -- scidb.org/download
CMake -- www.cmake.org
HDF5 libraries and headers (e.g., yum install hdf5 hdf5-devel)

RHEL5 RPMS for HDF5 are available at: 
http://www.slac.stanford.edu/~danielw/hdf/
You need the -static and -devel packages at minimum, and probably the plain 
hdf5 rpm too.

How to build:
------------
Standard cmake steps should work.

Suppose you've checked out the source into /home/daniel/scidbhdf

1. Make a build directory, say /home/daniel/scidbhdf-bld
2. cd into your build directory ("cd /home/daniel/scidbhdf-bld")
3. "cmake <your-source-directory>" ("cmake /home/daniel/scidbhdf")
4. Patch locations for dependencies as needed by "ccmake <build-directory>"
  ("ccmake /home/daniel/scidbhdf-bld",
    or just "ccmake ." if $PWD=="/home/daniel/scidb-hdf-bld")
5. Within your build directory, "make"

The "loader" binary will be created within the "src" subdirectory.  It is 
hardcoded to use a particular HDF5 file and to read a particular tree within.
