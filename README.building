Building using cmake can be difficult, especially for those unfamiliar
with cmake.  The authors regret that their cmake expertise is limited
and may contribute to a more difficult build experience.



Build recommendations
---------------------
* Do not build in-tree. This means: Please do not run "cmake ." in the
same directory as your source tree checkout.

Prerequisites
-------------
* CFITSIO
* CCfits
* HDF5
* SciDB source tree (tested with 0.75+)

When installing via your distribution's package manager, please ensure
that you install the development headers as well as the compiled
binaries. On RPM-based systems 
(e.g., RedHat, Fedora) this means you must install the -devel
packages. On Debian/Ubuntu-based systems, you should install the
-headers packages.


Using dependencies in non-standard locations 
--------------------------------------------
SciDB-HDF5 was developed on a system without root-access, so if you
can't install dependencies into the usual system-wide locations,
you'll need to instruct the cmake on where to find dependencies.

The easiest way is to specify BASE_DIR.  Assuming you installed
the dependencies into non-standard locations using a --prefix=<dir>
(or equivalent), you can specify BASE_DIR, and the build script will
look there for all of its dependencies.

You can also specify directories for each dependency:
CFITSIO_ROOT_DIR
CCFITS_ROOT_DIR
SCIDB_ROOT_DIR

Note that SCIDB_ROOT_DIR must always be specified, since a full SciDB
source tree checkout is needed to build this module.
